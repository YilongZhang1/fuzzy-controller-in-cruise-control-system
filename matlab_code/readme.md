All of the code is designed in matlab.

1. The fuzzy logic controller
The fuzzy logic controller is designed in matlab fuzzy toolbox, and it's in the file "Group10_autoControl.fis". It can be opened following 3 steps:
	1) start matlab;
	2) type in "fuzzy" in command window;
	3) "File" -> "Import" -> "Load from file..."
	
2. Group10_scenario_X.slx
They are matlab simulink files, representing the 3 different scenarios in our experiments.

3. .fig files
They are experiment results of the 3 different scenarios. These results are analyzed in our report.
